4/22/2014 Updates:<br>
* Right clicking both icons which are already connected disconnects them.<br>
* Icons only glow (gradient green) when connected properly now.<br>
* Enforcing connection orders now.  Load Balancer -> Language Pack -> Service.<br>
<br>
4/23/2014 Updates:<br>
* Lines now follow icons that are being dragged.<br>
* Fixed a memory leak problem.<br>
* Added Nodejs, Newrelic and Memcached icons<br>
* Rearranged icons with load balancer on the left, language packs on top and services on the right<br>
* May not connect the original icons on the edges of the screen anymore.<br>
* Added icon labels<br>
<br>
4/24/2014 Updates:<br>
* Added some very basic physics to move objects around when dragged/dropped while connected to other objects.  Still needs much work, don't look too hard at this yet.
